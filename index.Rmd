Day <- c("Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
sched <- expand.grid(Time, Day)
colnames(sched) <- c("Time", "Day")
sched$What <- "Hands on"
sched$What[sched$Time %in% c(11.5, 14)] <- "Lecture"

sched$What[sched$Time %in% c(12, 12.5)] <- "Lunch (provided)"

sched$Y <- Y[as.character(sched$Time)]
ggplot(sched, aes(x = Day, y = Y, fill = What)) + geom_tile(color = "grey80") + theme_minimal() + 
    scale_y_continuous("Time", breaks = Y + .25, labels = Time) + scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual") + 
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
