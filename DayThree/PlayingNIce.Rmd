## Overview

_Working with other packages_ can mean:

* importing functionality from installed packages

* adding code, modifications to existing packages which are not yours 

* including code from other packages into your own

Technical, legal, social, philosophical implications

General advice:

* Don't worry too much (DWTM)
* Rapid prototyping, iterative improvement 
* _"Quality of life, quality of research (code)"_


## Depends, Imports, Suggests, Enhances: use one

Your package uses another installed package to do something:

* Your package: `mypkg`
* Other package: `otherpkg`

__Depends:__

* `otherpkg` necessary for installing `mypkg`
* After `library(mypkg)`, `otherpkg` will be in the search path for the user
* Use case: `mypkg` really only makes sense in the context of `otherpkg`, e.g. `latticeExtra` and `lattice` 
* Recommend: use rarely

__Imports:__

* `otherpkg` necessary for installing `mypkg`
* Functions etc. in `otherpkg` will be used internally by `mypkg`
* Details can be controlled in `NAMESPACE`
* Recommend: use this for necessary packages

__Suggests:__

* `otherpkg` NOT necessary for installing `mypkg` 
* For packages only used in examples, vignettes, tests
* Typical use case: example data from another package

__Enhances:__

* `otherpkg` NOT necessary for installing `mypkg` 
* When `mypkg` adds functionality to `otherpkg`
* Use case: `mypkg` has extra methods for classes defined in `otherpkg`

## NAMESPACE specification

Reference: _Writing R Extensions_, Section 1.5

###  Exports 

* Only exported functions are visible after `library(mypkg)` or via `mypkg::`
* Unexported functions are available as `mypkg:::`
* Suggestion: 

    - start with default (export all, `exportPattern("^[^\\.]")`),
    - add `@export`-tags before release
    - don't export hacks, functions you don't document

## Imports

* `import(otherpkg)` in NAMESPACE corresponds to `library(otherpkg)` in linear code
* Qualified names `otherpkg::` will work without `import`/`importFrom`
* Suggestion: 

    - `@Ã¬mport` important packages at start (replace `library`)
    - use qualified names  during development
    - switch to `@import` when you get tired of `otherpkg::`
    - before release, check whether to replace `@import` with `@importFrom`
    - use qualified names when in doubt
    
## Contributing to other packages

* Report issues: informatively, politely (minimal replicable example)

* Add fixes via _forking_:

    - establish a private copy of a package (dead easy on Github)
    - make modifications
    - offer modifications to package owner (_pull request_)
    - Alt.: if the licence allows, go rogue with your own (_forked_) version 
    
        + Nuclear option
        + Give credit
        + Change names, trademarks

* Play nice: e.g. `ggplot2` [code of conduct](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

* [Legal aspects](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1154/how-does-githubs-forking-right-cope-with-an-all-rights-reserved-project/1157) of forking on Github

## Using material from other packages in your own

* Legal under open source licence _under certain conditions_

    - E.g.: "viral" property of GPL

* For legal & ethical reasons: _give credit_

## We have to talk about licenses

Software licensing matters in research, same as data protection & citation rules.

[Licensing R](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/): not a legal document, but 

* overview of current practice
* overview of open source (vs proprietary) licenses

## Do I have to share? 

* No.

* But you should think about it:

    - private vs public package: who to share with?
    - open vs proprietary licence
    - open access and open source
